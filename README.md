# Data Types and Variables in C# 

## 1. Data Types in C#

Data types in C# define the type of data a variable can store. They tell the compiler how much memory to allocate and what operations can be performed.

## 2. Variables

A **variable** is a container used to store data values. Its value can change during program execution.

### Rules for Naming Variables

- Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`)
- Cannot start with a number
- No spaces allowed
- Should not use reserved keywords
- Use meaningful names

### Valid Names

- `totalMarks`
- `_count`
- `studentName`

### Invalid Names

- `1total`
- `student name`

## 5. Types of Variables (Based on Scope)

### 1. Local Variable
- Declared inside a method  
- Used only within that method  

### 2. Instance Variable
- Declared inside a class but outside methods  
- Each object has its own copy  

### 3. Static Variable
- Declared using the `static` keyword  
- Shared by all objects of the class

## 6. Importance of Data Types and Variables

- Help in memory management  
- Improve program readability  
- Make programs error-free  
- Used to store and process data

## 7. Conclusion

Data types specify what kind of data a variable can store, while variables store the actual data. They are the basic building blocks of any programming language.
